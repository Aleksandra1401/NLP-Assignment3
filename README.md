**Finding Similar Questions using Embeddings**  


Question 1:  
Demonstrates embedding generation using FastText model on Post_law data. Saves the model for potenttial use in future.  
  
Question 2:
Demonstrates finding similar questions using pretrained fastText model embeddings and Pytorch NN designed from scratch.

Due to github limit of file size some files should be added manually.
Files needed to run:
Post.py                               - post definition  
Posts_law.xml                         - stack exchange data  
duplicate_questions.tsv               - questions with similars
